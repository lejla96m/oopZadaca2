Create the class Bookshelf. The bookshelf class holds Books (class) in a list of Books.

Book:

Attributes:
* title - String
* ISBN - long
* author - String

Constructor:

3 parameters, setting the values of attributes

Method:

toString() - returning a String in the format title, author (ISBN)

Bookshelf:

1 Attribute being a list of Books

Constructor without parameters, creating an empty BookShelf

Methods:

* addBook(Book book) - adds book to shelf

* containsBook(String title) - returning boolean depending if the shelf contains a Book with the
provided title

* containsBook(long ISBN) - returning boolean depending if the shelf contains a Book with the
provided ISBN

* printBookshelf() - prints all Books from the bookshelf

Create the class Robot. The Robot moves on a plane similar to a coordinate system.

It has 2 constructors:
* Without parameters - the Robot starts at position (0,0)
* With 2 parameters - initialises the Robot at position (x,y)

The Robot has couple of methods:
* moveSouth() - moves the Robot to the south, meaning it will decrease the y.position by 1
* moveNorth() - moves the Robot to the north, meaning it will increase the y.position by 1
* moveEast() - moves the Robot to the east, meaning it will increase the x.position by 1
* moveWest() - moves the Robot to the west, meaning it will decrease the x.position by 1
* getPosition() - return current position
* double getDistance() - returns the euclidean distance from the initial position
The distance is calculated as sqrt((x0 - x1)2 + (y0 - y1)2), where (x0, y0) is the initial position and
(x1, y1) being the current position. The distance is a double.
* getMoves() - return the number of moves the Robot performed
* printLastPosition(int n) - prints the n last position starting from the last (backwards)
if n > number of moves, print all moves
Example of print:
(2,5)
(1,5)
(1,4)
